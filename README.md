# NumpyViT
This project involves implementing a Vision Transformer (ViT) from scratch using NumPy. It will entail constructing and integrating various components like patch embedding, Transformer encoders, and a classifier head, with a focus on meticulous testing and validation at each step to ensure robustness and accuracy.
